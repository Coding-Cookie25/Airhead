# AirHead 🌿💨

**AirHead** is a web and mobile platform that increases awareness of local air quality, encourages eco-friendly actions, and builds a gamified community for environmental engagement.

---

## Problem Statement
- People often don’t realize how bad local air quality is.  
- There’s no easy way for communities to act together.  
- Individual awareness is low and scattered.

---

## Core Idea
AirHead shows real-time air quality in your area, nudges people to take action (plant trees, cycle, walk, carpool), and builds a gamified community where actions are tracked and celebrated.

---

## Phase 1: Core Features
1. **Data Collection**  
   Connect to open air quality APIs (e.g., OpenWeather, WAQI).  

2. **Local Display**  
   Simple dashboard showing today’s Air Quality Index (AQI) with color-coded indicators (safe/unsafe).  

3. **Community Feed**  
   Users share daily actions like “I walked to work today” or “I planted a tree”.  

4. **Gamification**  
   Points, badges, and streaks for consistent eco-friendly actions.  

5. **Awareness Tips**  
   Daily short tips like “Wear a mask today” or “Best indoor plant: Spider Plant”.

## Phase 2: Future Upgrades
1. **Tree Verification**  
   AI photo check or QR codes with verified nurseries.  

2. **Wearable Integration**  
   Link with smartwatches for step count and cycling miles.  

3. **Carbon Footprint Tracker**  
   Estimate saved CO₂ with actions.  

4. **Leaderboard**  
   City, college, or school rankings.  

5. **Event Challenges**  
   E.g., “Plant 100 trees this month” as a community challenge.

## Possible Add-ons
- Reward system: discount coupons from eco brands.  
- School/college dashboards to show youth engagement.  
- Offline kiosks in parks or cafes showing live AQI and community progress.

---

## Technical Stack Suggestions
- **Frontend**: React Native (app), React or Angular (web)  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB or MySQL (storing user actions and points)  
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap or WAQI for pollution data  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth or JWT  
- **Hosting**: Heroku or AWS free tier initially

---

## Impact Goals
- Increase community awareness about local pollution.  
- Encourage sustainable transport and greenery.  
- Build eco habits through gamification.  
- Connect online data with real offline action gradually.
